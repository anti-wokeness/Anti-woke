# Anti-woke
This Anti-woke extension highlights words and displays a warning message for websites, companies, and brands that engage in wokeness.

You can turn on or off the top-banner and word-highlighting in the extension settings.

Wokeness is a fixation on class, gender, and race and the perceived oppression between those identities. One example is telling employees "Try to be less white". Companies exist to deliver services to their customers and not to preach woke politics.
