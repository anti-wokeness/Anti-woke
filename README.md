# Anti-woke
This Anti-woke extension highlights words and displays a warning message for websites, companies, and brands that engage in woke behavior and wokeness. Sometimes an alternative provider of the same service from a company that does not engage in woke behavior will be displayed.

You can turn on or off the top-banner and word-highlighting in the extension settings.

Wokeness refers to tings such telling employees "Try to be less white" or advertising to men that they need to get rid of their "toxic masculinity". Companies exist to deliver services to their customers and not to preach woke politics.

Anti-woke is also available as an Android app:
